Redesigning my portfolio for the *nth* time. 

### Technologies / framework

The actual code structure is something I've picked up while working on a project at Equinor. It's not how all projects are done at Equinor, but it's how ours was set up. I enjoyed working with this structure, which is why I brought it with me to this project.

* React
* Typescript
* styled-components

On the backend, I've got a Wordpress instance that I use as a headless CMS, as well as an AWS serverless function for dealing with sending emails. 

### Design

I went for a spacey pink/purpley design with a flavour of "programming-style" design. The fonts are

* IBM Plex Mono
* IBM Plex Sans

The deep dark purple is **#171727** , and the bright pink is **#C371A3**. Most of the other colors are different shades of these colors.

The design is also coupled with a lot of animations, mainly on the borders. I consider "moving lines" as a part of the design language of the site. 

The site also features a lot of gradients, going mainly from purple to pink in different directions.
